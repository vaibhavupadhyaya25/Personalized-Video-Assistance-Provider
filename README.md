# Personalized-Video-Assistance-Provider

Datasets:


1. This project scans a dataset of trending videos provided by kaggle and builds a predictive model using machine learning techniques like OLS(ordinary least squares) method and multiple regression.

2. It fetches real time youtube data using the Youtube Data V3 API and builds the dataset. The dataset exported in csv format is fed to python using pandas library. The tool used for this is Jupyter Notebook. Data cleaning, Data visualization, Data normalization and Data prediction are acheived.


System:
It provides a graphical interface developed in Tkinter using python which lets user to enter values/parameters and check the worth at runtime before actually uploading the video on Youtube. It tells its chance of getting viral and an estimated view count that it will achieve in coming next week. It also allows user to tune theri values dynamically and see the results. It provides real time suggestions by connecting to multiple social platforms like Reddit and Instagram. It crawls multiple webistes with related content to provide better hashtags and their impact on the content.


Model Implementation:
It is backed by a self developed model named as RAC model that is based on a traditional model named SIR model that studies the fusion of data in the social media. It uses mathematical equations to calculate the chance of content getting viral.
